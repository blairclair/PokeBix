## Project Description
PokéBix is a voice activated Pokédex that allows you to easily find detailed information about your favorite Pokémon.

## Why Should It Win?
PokéBix demonstrates how to query multiple endpoints of an API to build models, which PokéBix uses to design views based off of custom layouts made to simulate a real Pokédex. Pokémon lovers will delight in being able to ask their PokéBix questions, just like Ash did in the original show!
