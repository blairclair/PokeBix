PokéBix demonstrates how to query multiple endpoints of an API to build models, which PokéBix uses to design views based off of custom layouts made to simulate a real Pokédex. Pokémon lovers will delight in being able to ask their PokéBix questions, just like Ash did in the original show!/
PokéBix won 3rd place in the Samsung Bixby hackathon at 42 Silicon Valley.
